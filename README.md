We registered in the Ui Path academy and installed Ui Path community edition. We started to learn about Ui Path and completed 2 parts in the first level of RPA Developer foundation. We studied in brief about variables, control structures and data types. The concept of flow charts and sequences gave us an base idea for our project design. There were also a few practical sessions that involved how to work in Ui Path, handling simple errors and creating flowcharts.
