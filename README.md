# E-Commerce data manipulation via Robotic Process Automation 
E-commerce data search using RPA is an automation project that will develop a proper search engine to find products in user required website. When we search for a particular information in any e-commerce web, the result is not ready for consumption and not clearly formatted. 
This project reduces the time and effort required to drill down each link and relevant information and collates the automated results in a table or an excel which is easy to consume, visualize and understand

We registered in the Ui Path academy and installed Ui Path community edition. We started to learn about Ui Path and completed 2 parts in the first level of RPA Developer foundation. We studied in brief about variables, control structures and data types. The concept of flow charts and sequences gave us an base idea for our project design. There were also a few practical sessions that involved how to work in Ui Path, handling simple errors and creating flowcharts.
